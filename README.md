# Real-estate-price-prediction
Within the framework of the project, a model predicting the value of real estate was created. The project includes data analysis, data cleaning, feature development and selection of the most efficient model. The model is trained on data about a wide variety of real estate types and their characteristics. 

This repository contains the code used to train the model (train.py), the code used to generate the prediction (predict.py), the necessary requirements (requirements.txt), the training data (train.csv) and sample data for prediction (public_test.csv).

# Reproducing a project
To reproduce this project follow these steps:
•	Install the required python packages specified in requirements.txt.
•	Download all files from the repository
•	Run train.py and than predict.py file on test data.
